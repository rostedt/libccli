DESCRIPTION
-----------
This is a simple API to create a CLI interface with the user. To start, create
the _ccli_ descriptor with *ccli_alloc()*. The interface created will have
the prompt defined by _prompt_ (none if _prompt_ is NULL), and till take over
control of the input and output file descriptors _in_ and _out_ (usually
passed in as STDIN_FILENO and STDOUT_FILENO respectively).

Calling *ccli_loop()* with the _ccli_ descriptor, will then read on the
input file descriptor waiting for input. The user (who is on the other end
of the file descriptor, probably at a terminal window) will see the
prompt and can start typing like in a normal shell. When they hit "enter"
commands will be executed that match the first word of what the user
typed.

By default, only the "exit" command is registered when the _ccli_ descriptor
is created. This will simply exit the loop.

Use *ccli_unregister_command()* to remove a registered command, including
the default "exit" command.

As the *ccli_loop()* is rather useless without more commands than just "exit",
it is expected to add new commands with *ccli_register_command()*. This takes
the _ccli_ descriptor, a command name (must be a single word), a _callback_
function to get called when the user enters it, and _data_ that will be
passed to the _callback_ (if needed).

The _callback_ has the following prototype:
[verse]
--
   int *callback*(struct ccli pass:[*]_ccli_, const char pass:[*]_command_, const char pass:[*]_line_,
		void pass:[*]_data_, int _argc_, char pass:[**]_argv_);
--

When the user enters the command that is registered, adds parameters, and then
hits "enter", the registered _callback_ function for that command will be
called with the following parameters:

_ccli_ - will be the _ccli_ descriptor returned by *ccli_alloc()*

_command_ - a string that matches the command that the user typed.

_line_ - The full line that the user typed when they hit "enter".

_data_ - The _data_ that was passed in when the command was registered with
         *ccli_command_register()*.

_argc_ - The number of words that the user typed. If the command had no
	other parameters but the command itself, then _argc_ will be 1.
	That means _argc_ will never be less than 1.

_argv_ - A string array of each word the user typed. Note, a word may
        have spaces in it if the user surrounded the string with
	single or double quotes.

Although _argv_ and _command_ may contain the same string, they are not
the same pointer. _command_ must not be modified, where's any of the stings
in _argv_, including the first one, is free to be modified. They will be
discarded on return of the _callback_.

By default, there is tab completion for any registered command. That is,
if the user types a few characters then hits tab, if what they type
matches a single command, it will be filled in for them. If there's more
than one match and the user hits tab more than once, it will display
a list of possible matches (similar to what bash does). But this is only for
the commands. For parameters after the command, any completions must be
registered with *ccli_register_completion()*, which takes the _ccli_
descriptor returned by *ccli_alloc()*, the _command_name_ to register a
_completion_ function for. Note, if the command that matches _command_name_
already has a completion function registered it, then it will be replaced by
_completion_ of this call. Only one completion function may be registered
to a command at a time.

The _completion_ function has the following prototype:
[verse]
--
   int *completion*(struct ccli pass:[*]_ccli_, const char pass:[*]_command_, const char pass:[*]_line_,
		 int _word_, const char pass:[*]_match_, char pass:[***]_list_, void pass:[*]_data_);
--

When the user hits "tab" for a command that has a completion registered to it,
the _completion_ callback is called with the following parameters:

_ccli_ - will be the _ccli_ descriptor returned by *ccli_alloc()*

_command_ - a string that matches the command of the first word.

_line_ - The full line up to where the user's cursor is.

_word_ - The index of the word being matched (zero being the command itself, and
	the first parameter would be one).

_match_ - The word that is currently being completed (empty if the cursor is
         on a space).

_list_ - A pointer to a string array that should be allocated and filled in
         with the list of possible matches.

_data_ - The _data_ that was passed in when the command was registered with
        *ccli_command_register()*.

The _completion_ callback is expected to allocate a list of strings (char pass:[**])
and fill it with allocated strings (char pass:[*]) of what matches. The return of
_completion_ is the number of allocated words in the _list_. If zero or negative
is returned, then *list should not be allocated, and any allocation done by _completion_
should be cleaned up before the return. See EXAMPLE for an example of handling
completions for a specific command.

The default operation of what happens when the user just hits enter (or
just has white space on the line) can be overridden with
*ccli_register_default()*. The _callback_ acts the same as for
*ccli_register_command()* but what gets passed to it is slightly different.
The _command_ will be an empty string (""), _argc_ will be 1 and _argv_
will be NULL.

The operation of what happens when the user enters a command that is not
registered can be overridden with *ccli_register_known()*. The _callback_
of this function will be called no registered command matches what the
user entered. The _callback_ for this acts the same as for
*ccli_register_command()*, where the first word entered will be passed in
as the _command_.

RETURN VALUE
------------
*ccli_alloc()* returns the descriptor to use to control the _ccfi_ interface,
and NULL on error.

*ccli_loop()* returns 0 on success (exited via a command) and -1 on error.

*ccli_registrer_command()* returns 0 on success and -1 on error.

*ccli_registrer_default()* returns 0 on success and -1 on error.

*ccli_registrer_default()* returns 0 on success and -1 on error.

*ccli_register_completion()* returns 0 on success and -1 on error.

ERRORS
------
The following errors are for all the above calls:

*ENOMEM* Memory allocation error.

*EINVAL* One of the input parameters was invalid.

For *ccli_register_command()* or *ccli_register_completion()*:

*ENODEV* - The command was not found.
