NAME
----
ccli_history - Commands for manipulating libccli history

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
--
*#include <ccli.h>*

const char pass:[*]*ccli_history*(struct ccli pass:[*]_ccli_, int _past_);
--

DESCRIPTION
-----------
libccli is a simple API to create a CLI interface with the user.
After a descriptor is created from *ccli_alloc(3)* and a command is registered
with *ccli_register_command(3)* or one of the similar functions, these are
the functions that can be useful in the callback.

The history of previous commands that were entered could be retrieved
via *ccli_history()* to get the pervious commands entered into the
_ccli_ descriptor. It will retrieve the command that was entered _past_
commands ago. This could be useful to replay a command from the default
callback this is registered by *ccli_register_default(3)*.

RETURN VALUE
------------
*ccli_history()* returns the string that represents a command that was
   entered before defined by the _past_ parameter. If _past_ goes back
   farther than the history that is stored, then NULL is returned.
   Note that the string that is returned is internal to the _ccli_
   descriptor and should not be modified.

ERRORS
------
The following errors are for all the above calls:

*ENOMEM* Memory allocation error.

*EINVAL* One of the input parameters was invalid.

EXAMPLE
-------
See *ccli_line_parse*(3) for an example.
